I am thrilled to announce the latest milestone in the advancement of Portuguese language technology - the Albertina PT ! This breakthrough comes from a dedicated team of researchers at the University of Lisbon and the University of Porto.

The Albertina PT is a Transformer model based on the DeBERTa architecture, setting a new state-of-the-art for both European Portuguese (PT-PT) and Brazilian Portuguese (PT-BR). It outperforms competing models in key language processing tasks and shows superior performance on the Portuguese GLUE tasks.

It's an exciting time for NLP, especially for our Portuguese-speaking colleagues and communities!
