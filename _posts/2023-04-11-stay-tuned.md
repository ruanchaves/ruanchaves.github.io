At present, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is [having its Stable Diffusion moment](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/11/llama/), marked by rapid advances and fascinating breakthroughs. This pace of growth can be, frankly, a bit daunting. Some have even humorously suggested that [Elon Musk's idea](https://fortune.com/2023/03/29/elon-musk-apple-steve-wozniak-over-1100-sign-open-letter-6-month-ban-creating-powerful-ai/) of a 6-month moratorium on creating powerful A.I. would be a welcome respite, allowing us to better digest the wealth of new research. But since that pause isn't likely to happen, how can we keep up with the latest in the field? Let's explore.

# Strategy 1: Leverage Specialized Platforms

Not surprisingly, there are platforms designed to help you discover new AI research papers. These sites leverage AI-powered search tools, sparing you the effort of manually browsing the internet. 

Take for instance, ZetaAlpha. Their free plan offers "a powerful neural search and focused discovery across relevant open AI content on arXiv, conferences, blogs and related Github code (100 searches per month)". It also lets you "discover trending papers on Twitter and easily find related work". ZetaAlpha's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@zetavector/videos) provides a treasure trove of insights on current research. 

I was fortunate to collaborate briefly with [Rodrigo Nogueira, a scientific advisor at Zeta Alpha](https://www.zeta-alpha.com/post/automated-research-assistants-and-neural-information-retrieval-an-interview-with-rodrigo-nogueira), on research pertinent to the platform's development. As part of the Neuralmind team, we made significant contributions in the field of information retrieval at the [COLIEE 2021 competition](https://ruanchaves.github.io/talks/2012-01-01-coliee-2021). You can check out [his latest talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsWjMRRl9dM) on their YouTube channel for a deeper understanding of the research underpinning the platform. 

Other noteworthy discovery platforms include [ResearchRabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/) and [Litmap](https://www.litmaps.com/). Litmap presents an engaging graph network visualization of citations between papers, such as the citation map for the first BERT paper [here](https://app.litmaps.com/seed/249502390?utm_source=litmaps&utm_content=home-seed).

# Strategy 2: Keep an Eye on Major Conferences  

Most groundbreaking research finds its way into a select group of prestigious journals and conferences. Robert Munro's list of [
The Top 10 NLP Conferences](https://www.junglelightspeed.com/the-top-10-nlp-conferences/) is an excellent guide, not just for its list of conferences, but also for the advice on discovering relevant work published elsewhere. In his words, these are the key conferences in the field: 

> "To keep it simple, in Natural Language Processing you really only need to look at these six conferences:

- [ACL: Association for Computational Linguistics](http://www.aclweb.org/)
- [EMNLP: Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing](http://hum.csse.unimelb.edu.au/emnlp2013/)
- [NAACL: North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics](http://naacl.org/)
- [EACL: European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics](http://www.eacl.org/)
- [COLING: International Conference on Computational Linguistics](http://www.coling-2014.org/)
- [CoNLL: Conference on Natural Language Learning](http://ifarm.nl/signll/conll/)

> You might also consider top conferences in related fields such as Information Retrieval, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Mining:

- [SIGIR: Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval](http://www.sigir.org/)
- [AAAI: Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence](http://www.aaai.org/)
- [ICML: International Conference on Machine Learning](http://icml.cc/)
- [ICDM: International Conference on Data Mining](http://icdm2013.rutgers.edu/)

> And a few relevant journals:

- [Journal of Computational Linguistics](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/coli)
- [Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics](http://www.transacl.org/)
- [Journal of Information Retrieval](http://www.springer.com/computer/database+management+%26+information+retrieval/journal/10791)
- [Journal of Machine Learning](http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10994)

> Here's a simple rule of thumb:

> If a paper is published in a *main* conference at one of these venues or in one of these journals, it's worth your time. If not, it might be better to skip it. The same rule applies to where you should aim to publish any groundbreaking research."

I recommend you read the [full article](https://www.junglelightspeed.com/the-top-10-nlp-conferences/) for more insight and possible exceptions to this rule. However, there's no denying its effectiveness. If you follow the papers published at these conferences, and track their authors and organizations on LinkedIn and Twitter, you're likely to stay updated on major breakthroughs just by scrolling through your social feeds.

# Strategy 3: Follow the Money

While the first two strategies can help you keep up with cutting-edge research, they might not reveal progress in NLP tooling. This is where strategies 3 and 4 come into play. Most research is experimental and not immediately applicable to production - and that's okay. However, if we're interested in the latest tools in NLP, a more effective approach is to track the rising stars in the market.

A simple way to do this is to explore the [Crunchbase page for the Natural Language Processing industry](https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/natural-language-processing-companies). Look for companies that have recently received seed funding, and check what people are saying about them on social media platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter. This can lead you to the latest tools being developed for NLP, whether open source or otherwise.

# Strategy 4: GitHub 

Lastly, don't forget to check out [trending Python repositories](https://github.com/trending/python?since=daily) on GitHub. This is a surefire way to discover trending open source NLP applications. And among other resources, you can also explore the [latest updated "awesome nlp" repositories](https://github.com/search?q=awesome+nlp&type=repositories&s=updated&o=desc).
